## CMPE561- Natural Language Processing Spring 2016 Term Project
#### About the Project  
  This repository contains the term project of CMPE561(Natural Language Processing) course. In this project, we try to duplicate the work in a paper namely 'A Computational Approach to Automatic Prediction of Drunk-Texting'[1].

In the paper, the authors try to predict whether the writer of tweet is drunk or not. It was a funny project for us.  

We use Php to gather the tweets and use Java to classify them. In Java side, we use maven for handling dependencies.
